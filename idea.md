# SayYes
A weekly connection for couples who choose to stay together

## What this is

SayYes is a relationship-support app for couples who have chosen to stay together — but feel that their relationship is no longer as easy, clear, or connected as it once was.

It is not therapy.
It does not diagnose.
It does not promise to save relationships.

SayYes exists for one reason:

To support couples who still choose each other, by giving them a simple, calm weekly structure to stay aligned.

## Why we are building this

Most long-term relationships and marriages do not end suddenly.

They fade.

They erode through:

- unspoken frustrations
- practical unfairness
- emotional distance
- repeated unresolved tensions

Most couples:

- wait too long to address issues
- avoid heavy solutions like therapy
- lack a neutral, non-confrontational way to check alignment

Existing solutions often fail because they are:

- too heavy (therapy-level commitment)
- too shallow (daily quotes, habits, reminders)
- too complex (scores, gamification, constant tracking)

What's missing is a lightweight, respectful structure for couples who want to stay connected before things break.

## The core belief

No tool can help if one person no longer wants the relationship.

But when both partners still want to continue, even strained or uncertain relationships can stabilize — if they are given:

- clarity
- structure
- space to reflect
- space to listen

SayYes starts with intention, not analysis.

## The commitment gate

Every couple begins with one private question, answered separately:

**"Do you want to keep working on this relationship?"**

Possible answers:

- Yes
- I'm unsure
- No

SayYes only supports couples who are willing to show up honestly.

The app never pressures someone to stay.
It supports clarity, not avoidance.

This question may reappear later — intentionally, not repetitively — when alignment weakens or clarity is needed.

## Who this is for

SayYes is for couples who:

- feel something is "off"
- keep arguing about the same things
- feel less connected than before
- want to prevent slow drift

It is not for:

- abusive relationships
- crisis or safety situations
- couples who have already decided to separate

## How it works (high level)

SayYes runs on a weekly rhythm, not daily engagement.

Once a week, each partner spends about 5–10 minutes answering a short check-in — privately.

The app then:

- observes alignment patterns
- highlights areas that need attention
- suggests one small, optional next step

No constant notifications.
No public scores.
No pressure.

## The weekly check-in

Each week includes five questions, covering the same core relationship areas every time — with slightly changing scope to avoid repetition.

### The five categories

1. Emotional support
2. Intimacy & desire
3. Money & fairness
4. Responsibilities & daily logistics
5. Respect & communication

### Example questions

- "Did you feel emotionally supported this week?"
- "Did you feel close or connected to your partner?"
- "Did financial matters feel fair and calm?"
- "Did responsibilities feel shared fairly?"
- "Did you feel listened to when something mattered?"

Answers use a simple 1–5 scale, with an optional short reflection.

The commitment question is used:

- at onboarding
- periodically (e.g. monthly)
- or when alignment trends suggest it's needed

Not every week.

## What the app does with the answers

SayYes does not show raw answers to partners.

Instead, it translates responses into gentle alignment states, such as:

- aligned
- partially aligned
- misaligned

Based on this, the app suggests one small action, for example:

- a short, guided conversation
- a listening-focused exercise
- an appreciation moment
- or sometimes, no action at all

The goal is not to fix everything —
it's to slow escalation and support awareness.

## Visual insight (over time)

Over time, couples can see monthly or yearly trends:

- how alignment changes
- which areas are improving
- which areas need care

Visuals are:

- neutral
- optional
- focused on trends, not judgment

They exist to create perspective, not pressure.

## When things get harder

If misalignment continues over several weeks:

- the app reduces advice
- emphasizes listening over fixing
- encourages clarity over forced repair

If one partner consistently signals disengagement:

- the app supports honesty
- avoids guilt or persuasion
- encourages respectful conversations about next steps

SayYes does not trap people in relationships.
It helps them face reality calmly.

## What this app is not

- Not couples therapy
- Not a diagnostic tool
- Not a happiness tracker
- Not a daily habit app

It does not promise outcomes.

It provides structure.

## Why this approach works

- Weekly cadence is sustainable
- Five practical questions feel meaningful for paid users
- Real-life categories surface real issues
- Commitment gate filters unworkable cases
- Neutral language reduces defensiveness
- Small, repeated moments matter more than deep analysis

## The philosophy

We don't fix relationships.
We support people who choose to keep them.

When intention is present, structure helps.
When intention is gone, honesty matters more than tools.

## What we are building

A calm, respectful space where couples can:

- pause
- reflect
- listen
- and decide — together — how to move forward

Nothing more.
Nothing less.
